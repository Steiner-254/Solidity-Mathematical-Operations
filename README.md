## Mathematical Operations in Solidity
- Smart contracts are high-level program codes that are compiled to EVM byte code and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for further execution. It allows us to perform credible transactions without any interference of the third party, these transactions are trackable and irreversible. Mathematical operations in solidity are as simple as we use these operations in real life. There are the following Mathematical Operations in Solidity:

1. Addition (x + y)
2. Subtraction: (x â€“ y)
3. Multiplication (x * y)
4. Division (x / y)
5. Modulus (x % y) 
6. Exponential  (x**y)
